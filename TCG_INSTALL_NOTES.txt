Installing BRASS on the farm


BRASS needs access to some perl modules. Mostly these live in /software/CGP/pancan/lib/perl5. Module Bio::DB::HTS is missing, however.


Need to install Bio::DB::HTS into ~/.perl:
1. Download from http://search.cpan.org/dist/Bio-DB-HTS/ using wget or curl
2. Run perl Build.PL --install_base ~/.perl
3. Run Build && Build test && Build install


Need to set environment variable CGP_PERLLIBS to point BRASS to its required perl modules
  export CGP_PERLLIBS=/software/CGP/pancan/lib/perl5:$HOME/.perl/lib/perl5:$CGP_PERLLIBS


In BRASS directory:
- bash setup.sh installation/path

The setup script builds Velvet, Blat and Exonerate. Normally, these builds are deleted at the end of installation. You can comment out this line (line ~310) in setup.sh to prevent them being deleted. This speeds up future rebuilds of BRASS.

rm -rf $SETUP_DIR
